# Hardware Checkout App Description
In this project, we will bring together the tools and techniques that we are learning in the class to implement a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a web application for a functioning HaaS system.

    o For the front-end, React.js, HTML, and CSS were used to create an appealing graphical user interface.
    o For the back-end, a MongoDB database was used to store user accounts and data.
    o To connect the front-end and backend, a RESTful API was developed using flask to query JSON  packages from the non-relational database.
    o The web service was deployed using Heroku.
