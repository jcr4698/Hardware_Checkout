# Hardware Checkout App Description
In this project, we will bring together the tools and techniques that we are learning in the class to implement a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a web application for a functioning HaaS system.

  * For the frontend, React.js, HTML, and CSS were used to create an appealing graphical user interface.
  * For the backend, a MongoDB non-relational database was used to store user accounts and data.
  * To connect the front-end and backend, a RESTful API was developed using Flask to query JSON packages from the database.
  * The web service was deployed using Heroku.
